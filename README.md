# 🎨 Visual Language & Shader Coding Study (Flutter Focus)

This repository explores how **visual language in film** can inspire **shader-based visual design** for 2D games focusing on **emotion, color, and texture** rather than 3D realism.  

> _“Studying how cinematic imagery can live inside interactive flat worlds.”_

## 🎥 Study Approach: Start Simple, Build Up

This project follows a **progressive learning approach** — starting with simple shader effects and gradually layering complexity inspired by cinematic imagery.

1. Begin with basic fragment shaders (film grain, color tint, vignette).  
2. Apply them to your 2D card game using Flutter’s shader API.  
3. Analyze how these visual effects mirror filmic techniques (composition, color, tone).  
4. Incrementally combine effects to simulate cinematic moods (e.g., noir, dreamy, retro).  

> _“Build from simplicity — each small shader teaches one piece of visual language.”_

## 🚀 Start here for new sessions

If you're opening this project in a **fresh ChatGPT session** (or for a new collaborator):

1. Read **`START_HERE_FOR_CHATGPT.md`** for the bootstrapping instructions and project preferences.
2. Then read **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** to continue from the topmost unchecked item.
3. Keep code clean, modern, and well-commented; target **WebGL2 / GLSL ES 3.00** and use `shaders/manifest.json`.
