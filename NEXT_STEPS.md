# 🎬 Next Steps – Film Scenes Shader Programming Study

_Last updated: October 22, 2025_

## ✅ Current Progress
- Repository structure created  
- `README.md` written (Flutter-focused visual language + shader plan)  
- `/research/flutter-shader-intro.md` complete — includes working example and shader integration guide  

---

## 🧭 Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Add first **scene study entry** in `/research/scene-study-template.md`  
- [ ] Begin shader folder with `film_vignette.frag` (from intro note)  
- [ ] Create minimal **Flutter test app** to load and display vignette shader  
- [ ] Document emotional/visual effect in the Visual Notebook  

---
## Track: In-Helmet HUD – WebGL (GLSL only)

- [ ] Run the WebGL demo (`webgl2/1_hud_lang/`) and verify Study 1 (flicker → lock)
- [ ] Tweak shader params (`u_lock` timeline, scanline strength, chroma split)
- [ ] Add 2+ text pairs (English ↔ Toki Pona) and test
- [ ] Use the Describe→Identify→Extract method (`docs/notes/method_film_analysis.md`)
- [ ] Write one analysis using the template (`docs/templates/scene-analysis-template.md`)
- [ ] Map analysis → shader tasks (fill the “Shader Mapping” section)
- [ ] Optional: Study 2 (per-glyph) in WebGL
- [ ] Optional: Study 3 (curvature/glow pass) in WebGL

---

## 🧪 Coming Soon
- [ ] `card_glow.frag`: hover/selection highlight shader  
- [ ] `film-to-shader-mapping.md`: translating film imagery into shader logic  
- [ ] Visual moodboard for **scene references and shader styles**  
- [ ] Begin integrating multiple shaders for stylistic comparison

## 💡 Note for Future Sessions

> When resuming this project:  
> - Refer to this `NEXT_STEPS.md` file first  
> - Choose one task or research note to expand (scene analysis, shader experiment, or documentation)  
> - Update this file with new progress and mark completed items with ✅  

This file acts as a **continuation anchor** for collaborative and iterative study across sessions.
