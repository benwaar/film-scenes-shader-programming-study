# ðŸŽ¬ Next Steps â€“ Film Scenes Shader Programming Study

_Last updated: October 22, 2025_

## âœ… Current Progress
- Repository structure created  
- `README.md` written (Flutter-focused visual language + shader plan)  
- `/research/flutter-shader-intro.md` complete â€” includes working example and shader integration guide  
- Visual Study Notebook (`.docx`) template created and linked  

---

## ðŸ§­ Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Add first **scene study entry** in `/research/scene-study-template.md`  
- [ ] Begin shader folder with `film_vignette.frag` (from intro note)  
- [ ] Create minimal **Flutter test app** to load and display vignette shader  
- [ ] Document emotional/visual effect in the Visual Notebook  

---
## Track: In-Helmet Display (HUD) Language Trainer
- [ ] Wire Study 1: `shaders/hud_text_flicker.frag` into demo and verify uniforms
- [ ] Add two text textures (English/Toki Pona) @ 1024w PNG, premultiplied alpha
- [ ] Script `u_lock` 0â†’1 over 3s and record a gif
- [ ] Move to Study 2: swap to SDF atlases; verify per-glyph flicker
- [ ] Add id map & glyph-UV metadata texture; tune flip cadence
- [ ] Study 3: enable glow pass + curvature; tweak scanlines/chroma
- [ ] Document final parameters in `docs/studies/in-helmet-display/shader-notes.md`

---

## ðŸ§ª Coming Soon
- [ ] `card_glow.frag`: hover/selection highlight shader  
- [ ] `film-to-shader-mapping.md`: translating film imagery into shader logic  
- [ ] Visual moodboard for **scene references and shader styles**  
- [ ] Begin integrating multiple shaders for stylistic comparison

## ðŸ’¡ Note for Future Sessions

> When resuming this project:  
> - Refer to this `NEXT_STEPS.md` file first  
> - Choose one task or research note to expand (scene analysis, shader experiment, or documentation)  
> - Update this file with new progress and mark completed items with âœ…  

This file acts as a **continuation anchor** for collaborative and iterative study across sessions.
