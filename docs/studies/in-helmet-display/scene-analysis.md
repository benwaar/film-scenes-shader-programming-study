# Scene Analysis: 80s Retro HUD Language Trainer

**Look.** Phosphor-ish CRT, faint barrel distortion, scanlines, occasional horizontal tear, subtle chroma separation, and a sweeping refresh bar. Text flips between languages per frame/glyph, then stabilizes.

**Why it reads as 80s.** Low persistence (scanlines), slight bloom around bright text, imperfect convergence (R/G/B split), and geometry warping (curved visor glass).

**Language flip beats.**
- Whole-line flicker (system selecting a language)
- Per-glyph flip (learning/recognition)
- Word-level lock (confidence achieved)

**Motion & timing.** Fast → easing → stillness. Audio beeps on tear or lock changes.
